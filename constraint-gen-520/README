constraint-gen-07(stable) TRIVIAL CHANGES
---------------------------------------------------------------

This is a minor fix over 06. Now adding functions one by one
to the source code by uncommenting only and not by copy pasting,
as was done earlier.

NEW CONVENTIONS

//AN ===> comment by Anshuman
//AH ===> comment by Komal
//KO ===> comment by Ahzaz

NEWADD ===> a new add during porting from 4.7.2 to 5.2.0

RULE: The older code should be commented out, and not deleted.

If using VIM editor, TagBar plugin can be used that will make the 
naviagation of functions very easy.


---------------------------------------------------------------
constraint-gen-04(unstable)
---------------------------------------------------------------
In this version, Only initialization function of parser is enabled
Rest of the code which is not related to initializatio is removed.
Inside initialization -'DEBUG' and 'cs_insert_vi_for_tree' functions are not resolved yet.

A three slash comment (///) in the code represents the portions which was removed by komal from the function and is yet to be resolved. other comments represent non relevant part to plugin.

constraint-gen-03: TRIVIAL CHANGES
----------------------------------------------------------------
Added block_information.cpp, block_information.hh to source.
Also added block_information.o as a dependency to plugin.so make target.

Compiles and runs successfully.

constraint-gen-02: MAJOR CHANGES
----------------------------------------------------------------

Basic plugin, that does nothing, but with important changes:

To test run:
$ make test


Changed Makefile, analysis_plugin.hh (MAJOR CHANGE) , analysis_plugin.cpp, common.hh (MAJOR CHANGE).

Makefile: made a new rule 'analysis' to test header dependencies with -H option
  of gcc. (Can be ignored)

analysis_plugin.hh: (MAJOR CHANGE) Tried to make minimalistic changes from to original version,
  and the code looks almost the same as original 4.7.2 so that the changes,
  can be easily seen.

  Also, the PASS NAME has been changed to 'cs618heap' so that if it is printed some
  where by GCC it can be easily spotted.

analysis_plugin.cpp: Portions of the code are commented to make it compile

common.hh: (MAJOR CHANGE) The order of includes of original header files of the,
  code are fixed, with systematised addition/deletion/reordering. The hard 
  dependencies between the header files were discovered to be:

    Dependencies: (x ==> y) y depends on x, so x preceds y

    stdio.h ==> vec.h
    gcc-plugin.h ==> vec.h
    <sstream> ==> gcc-plugin.h     # note below
    # reversing the order leads to this error
    # "locale_facets.h: error: macro "toupper" passed 2 arguments"
    tree.h ==> cgraph.h
    tree-ssa-alias.h ==> gimple.h
    basic-block.h ==> gimple.h
    gimple-expr.h ==> gimple.h


  Have included iostream for diagnostic std::err messages for debugging 
  purposes.
